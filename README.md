# Verilog-Codes-Combinational-Circuits [testbench included]

This project contains all of the Verilog codes for combinational circuits that I have practiced. 
The outputs of the codes are as follows and the codes along with their testbench are provided in the respective repositories.

## 4-bit Comparator
